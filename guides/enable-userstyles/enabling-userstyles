4. Open the following page [about:support](about:support) click the open folder button labeled 'Profile Folder'

5. In the directory that opened create a folder labeled 'chrome'

6. Open the chrome folder and create a file called 'userChrome.css'

### Notes

- Firefox needs to restart before changes made to userChrome are reflected, note you can get around this by using the Browser Toolbox.

Using the 'Style Editor' tab and the search box we can quickly find and open the userChrome file.
